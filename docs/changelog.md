# Changelog

## [2026-04-15] - YouTube Cookie Synchronization Optimization

### ✨ Added
- **Docker Volume Mount**: The `telegram-bot-summary` container now mounts `cookies.txt` as a volume. This allows the bot to receive real-time cookie updates from the host without needing to rebuild the image or restart the container.
- **Chrome Docker Integration**: Automated extraction of cookies from a running Chrome container using `yt-dlp`.

### 🚀 Improved
- **Optimized Cookie Extraction**: Rewrote `extract_youtube_cookies.sh` to be significantly faster. It now uses a lightweight URL (`google.com`) and disables playlist metadata extraction, reducing execution time from minutes to seconds.
- **Robustness**: Added file existence and size checks in the extraction script to prevent overwriting valid cookies with empty ones.
- **Permissions**: Added automatic `chmod 644` in the sync script to ensure the Docker container has read access to the mounted cookie file.

### 🔧 Fixed
- **Crontab Automation**: Fixed incorrect paths and formatting in the user crontab. Updated schedules to ensure `yt-dlp` updates and cookie extraction happen sequentially (3 AM and 4 AM).
- **Persistent Updates**: Updated `auto_update_ytdlp.sh` to include the volume mount, ensuring that the feature persists after automatic container updates.
